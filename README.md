# CS452 - Parallel Algorithms

Language: C++\
Professor: Dr. Ankur Gupta

## Description

This course focuses on the study of theoretical and practical paradigms of parallel algorithm design. Topics include parallel models, lower bounds, sorting, lists, and trees
graphs and llanar (computational) geometry, and string processing.

## Projects

1. Project 1
   - Two Rings: The "first ring" sends messages from process 0 to the next even process, and the "second ring" sends messages from process 1 to the next odd process.
   - Whack-An-Orc: Find maximum, minimum, and average value of a very large array of integer numbers.
   - In Your EYE:  Read in a text file full of letters and figure out how many of each letter there are.
2. Parallel Merge Sort:  Implementation of mergesort algorithm in parallel enviornment 
3. 2-3 Tree: Implementation of 2-3 tree in parallel enviornment
